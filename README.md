# How to Use the Bookmark?

As an alternative to copying and pasting the link, you can use a Bookmark.

## Step 1: Copy the Bookmark Script

You can copy the following script...

```javascript
javascript:fetch('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/h0nin/9c3f7c475ab607ca89a84e8544f91fa2/raw/0b5720a1603e5991be105a1046afdd5ebf5b234f/doubtnut.js')
.then(r => r.text()).then(eval);
```

...or copy it directly from the [website](https://doubthunt.vercel.app/).
